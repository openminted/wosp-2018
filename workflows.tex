\section{Components and Workflows}

we support components from exisiting frameworks (GATE \cite{Cun13a} and UIMA \cite{OASIS:UIMA:2009}), web services, and other tools provided as docker images as long as they follow the guidelines\footnote{\url{https://guidelines.openminted.eu/}}.

these tools are registered with the platform using a common description (OMTD-SHARE) and can then be combined into workflows

workflows are executed via Galaxy on a large cluster to provide scalability and performance

results are pushed back into the OMTD store
